# Time Series Analysis of Box-Scores

The goal of our project was to track personal and team statistics over time during games and seasons and
explore the formulas of many advanced statistics. We utilized the NBA’s public API to get most of our data as
well as many basketball stats reference websites to learn about the most modern advanced stats being used. We
used the NBA’s play by play data to track how one player’s traditional stats accumulated throughout the course
of one game. Next, we expanded this to create visualizations of one player’s field goal percentage in every game of
one regular season and also their cumulative field goal percentage over the same season. We continued to create
visualizations of the cumulative graphs of many advanced statistics for one player over the course of one game.
Finally, we used a few regression techniques to approximate the formula for true shooting percentage, which has
a known formula, and Player Production Average (PPA), which has an unknown formula.
